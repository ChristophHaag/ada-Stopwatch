Usage:

Single Stopwatch:
Call Stopwatch.Start, then call Stopwatch.Stop, then receive the
duration between those calls as String with Stopwatch.Get_Time_Image
(or an error message if you did it wrong).
Also, get the current STATE with Get_State
(for not relying on Strings as result).

Multiple Stopwatches:
First create the array with stopwatches:
- Create_Stopwatches (count : Positive):
Then all of the above procedures and functions are available with
the index as argument.
